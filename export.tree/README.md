# MIND: Multilingual Imaging Neuro Dataset

This repository contains structural and functional MRI data of 126 monolingual and bilingual participants with varying language backgrounds and proficiencies.

This README is organized into two sections:

1. [**Usage**](#usage) describes how one can go about recreating data derivatives and brain measures from start to finish.
2. [**Directories**](#directories) gives information on the file structure of the dataset.

If you just want access to the processed brain and language data, go to [Quick Start](#quick-start).

# Usage
There are two ways that one can go about this dataset. If you want to jump immediately into analyzing participants and their language profiles, then go to [Quick Start](#quick-start). If instead you are looking to go from low-level MRI data to cleaned CSVs with various brain measure types, either to learn the process or double check our work, then go to [Data Replication](#data-replication).

## Quick Start
If you just want access to cleaned brain measure and language history data of 126 participants, they can be found in the following folders:

-  **Brain Data:** [processing_output](processing_output)
- **Language Data:** [language_background](language_background)

Each folder has a metadata.xlsx file that gives more information on the files and their fields. Have fun, go nuts.

## Data Replication

If you are looking to go through the steps required to create the data from start to finish, we first start with the raw structural and functional MRI data, which can be found in **./sub-EBE{XXXX}**. Information on the data in this folder, which follows BIDS, can be found [here](https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/en/stable/appendices/entity-table.html).

The data in **./sub-EBE{XXXX}** is then inputted into various processing pipelines, the versions for which can be found at [Dependency versions](#dependency-versions). The following processing pipelines are used:

- ### fMRIprep
    fMRIprep is a neuroimaging procesing tool used for task-based and resting-state fMRI data. fMRIprep is not used directly to create brain measure CSVs used in analysis, but instead creates processed fMRI data used in the [CONN toolbox](#3-conn). For more information on fMRIprep and how to use it, click [here](https://fmriprep.org/en/stable/).

- ### CAT12
    We use the CAT12 toolbox, which stands for Computational Anatomy Toolbox, to calculate brain region volumes using voxel-based morphometry [(VBM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voxel-based_morphometry). CAT12 works through SPM12 and Matlab, and requires that both be [installed](#dependency-versions). We have included the Matlab scripts used to create the files in ./derivatives/CAT12 in [preprocessing_scripts/cat12](preprocessing_scripts/cat12). To use it, install necessary dependencies [(CAT12, SPM12, and Matlab)](#dependency-versions) and run [preprocessing_scripts/cat12/CAT12_segmentation_n2.m](preprocessing_scripts/cat12/CAT12_segmentation_n2.m) in Matlab. You will also need to update for your local path to Matlab on lines 12, 24, and 41. For more information on CAT12 and how to use it to calculate brain region volumes using VBM, click [here](https://neuro-jena.github.io/cat12-help/).

- ### CONN
    CONN is a functional connectivity toolbox, which we used to generate participant brain connectivity measures. CONN requires first that you run the [fMRIprep pipeline](#1-fmriprep), as it uses some of fMRIprep's outputs as input. Like CAT12, CONN works through SPM12 and Matlab and requires that both be [installed](#dependency-versions). For more information on CONN and how to use it, click [here](https://web.conn-toolbox.org/resources/conn-documentation).

- ### FDT
    We used FMRIB's Diffusion Toolbox (FDT) for extracting values from diffusion weighted images. For more information on FDT and how to use it, click [here](https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/docs/#/diffusion/index).

- ### Freesurfer
    FreeSurfer is a software package for the analysis and visualization of structural and functional neuroimaging data, which we use to extract region volumes and cortical thickness through surface-based morphometry [(SBM)](https://en.citizendium.org/wiki/Surface-based_morphometry). For more information on Freesurfer and how to use it, click [here]((https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki)).

<br>

The results from these pipelines, which use the data in **./sub-EBE{XXXX}** as input, are then outputted into folders in **./derivatives**. For information on which folder stores each pipeline result, see [Directories](#directories).

After running these pipelines, we can take their outputs and convert them into CSVs for analysis. To do this, we use [preprocessing_scripts/brain_data_preprocessing.ipynb](preprocessing_scripts/brain_data_preprocessing.ipynb). This Python notebook takes the data in ./derivatives as input and outputs CSVs to [processing_output](processing_output). Outputted from this notebook are CSVs containing brain volumes, cortical thicknesses, fractional anisotropy values, and connectivity measures. Information on the outputted CSVs can be found at [processing_output/metadata.xlsx](processing_output/metadata.xlsx).
